<h1> ConsoleRPG </h1>
<hr>
<p> ConsoleRPG is a text based rpg game I am working on to hone my C# skills. </p>
<p> I am trying to update this repo at least once or twice a week to add new content and test out
new things I am learning. </p>
<p> Currently the game is in it's VERY beginning stage and hardly considered playable. </p>
<h2> Current features include: </h2>
<ul>
<li> Choose one of 4 available classes </li>
<li> Choose from two monsters to battle </li>
<li> Battle the selected monster to gain loot </li>
</ul>
<p> Check back often for updates!</p>
